    -   Copy the "Search engine ID" (CX ID)
3.  **Configure in App**
    -   Enter Google API Key in "Google API Key" field
    -   Enter CX ID in "Custom Search Engine ID" field

## üìñ Usage

### Basic Usage

1.  Configure your LLM provider (see Configuration section)
2.  Start chatting by typing in the input field
3.  Watch the agent work as it breaks down tasks and uses tools
4.  Get completion confirmation when all tasks are finished

### Example Interactions

**Search Tasks**
-   "Search for the latest AI news and summarize the top 3 articles"
-   "Find information about Python programming best practices"
-   "Look up weather in New York and plan outdoor activities"

**Calculation Tasks**
-   "Calculate 15% tip on a $84.50 bill"
-   "Generate the first 15 Fibonacci numbers"
-   "Sort this array in ascending order: [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]"

**Complex Multi-Tool Tasks**
-   "Search for current Bitcoin price, then calculate how much 0.5 BTC would be worth"
-   "Find the population of Tokyo and calculate population density per square kilometer"
-   "Look up JavaScript array methods and show me examples of map, filter, and reduce"

**AI Reasoning Tasks**
-   "Write a business plan outline for a food delivery startup"
-   "Explain quantum computing in simple terms"
-   "Create a study schedule for learning web development in 3 months"

### Demo Mode

If no LLM is configured, the app runs in demo mode:
-   Test JavaScript execution: "calculate fibonacci"
-   Test search simulation: "search for something"
-   Test tool integration: "sort an array"

## üìÅ File Structure

### Key Components

-   `AgenticChatBot`: Main class handling the application
-   `Agentic Loop`: Core logic for autonomous task execution
-   `Tool System`: Pluggable tools (Search, JavaScript, AI tasks)
-   `LLM Integration`: OpenAI-compatible API interface
-   `UI Components`: Bootstrap-based responsive interface

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Test button not working"**
-   **Cause**: CORS restrictions in browser
-   **Solution**: Skip test and try chatting directly - it often works even when test fails

**"LLM not responding"**
-   Check API key is correct
-   Verify you have credits/quota remaining
-   Try different model (`gpt-4o-mini` is most reliable)

**"Google Search not working"**
-   Verify both API key and CX ID are entered
-   Check Google Cloud Console for API usage/errors
-   Ensure Custom Search API is enabled

**"JavaScript execution shows undefined"**
-   Code should include `return` statements for values
-   Use objects for multiple results: `return { result: value }`

### Network Issues

If you encounter CORS or network errors:
-   Make sure you're using a local server (not opening the HTML file directly)
-   Try a different LLM provider
-   Check the browser console for detailed error messages

## üéØ Advanced Features

### Tool Development

To add new tools, extend the tools array in `setupTools()`:

```javascript
{
  type: "function",
  function: {
    name: "your_tool_name",
    description: "Description of what your tool does",
    parameters: {
      type: "object",
      properties: {
        param1: {
          type: "string",
          description: "Parameter description"
        }
      },
      required: ["param1"]
    }
  }
}
Then implement the tool in the executeTool() method. ```

## Customization
Styling: Modify CSS in the <style> section of the HTML file
Models: Add new models to the <select> options
Providers: Add new LLM providers in the updateConfig() method
Loop Limits: Adjust maxLoops in the agenticLoop() method
##üîê Security Notes
API Keys: Never commit API keys to version control.
JavaScript Execution: Code runs in a browser context - generally safe but avoid sensitive operations.
Input Validation: User inputs are processed by the LLM - standard web security practices apply.
## üìä API Usage & Costs
AIPipe
Pricing: Pay-per-use, typically cheaper than direct OpenAI
Models: Access to latest GPT models
Benefits: Simplified billing, no separate OpenAI account needed
OpenAI Direct
